\section*{Experience}
\subsection*{New Relic \subtitle San Francisco, CA Summer 2016}

% maybe just in general think about writing these experiences more as stories?

Made significant, critical contributions to the newly-launched Infrastracture
product, working closely with my team as well as others to (reach the full scope
of milestones).

% reached the full scope sounds weird, honestly. I'd like to use scope, since
% that's what pancakes told me directly, but maybe I should pick better verbiage.

\subsection*{Arrayent \subtitle Redwood City, CA Summer 2015}

Managed and resolved issues with critical production systems with real-time
availability requirements. Learned to effectively instrument and monitor cloud
infrastructure, both with cloud providers like AWS and locally, on the metal.

\subsection*{NASA Ames \subtitle Mountain View, CA 2011-2014}

\subsection*{FRC Team 8 Robotics \subtitle Palo Alto, CA 2012-2014}

\subsection*{BSA Troop 14 \subtitle Palo Alto, CA 2011-2013}

\section*{Personal Projects}

I always look for ways to deepen my understanding of computer science, and
personal projects provide the perfect opportunity.

\subsection*{FLX/BIS2}

This bash history search project is something I use every day. It is a fast
fuzzy search algorithm and frontend that improves searching through command
history in terminal.

\subsection*{Kernel}

Curiosity, and the desire to know how things work drive my interests in a major
way. Kernel is my effort to build an OS kernel how I wish they could be, with a
focus on transactions and modularity.

\subsection*{Corepack}

% Maybe pick a better project here? I'm not a huge fan of talking about this one
% a ton, since it's so focused on the backend

\section*{Skills}

Twelve years of experience in software engineering

Diverse (experience) with many industry-tested tools and frameworks, such as
Spring, React, ElasticSearch

Deep interest in the cutting edge, such as Rust, ES6, and C++17

\section*{Education}

\subsection*{The University of British Columbia \subtitle Vancouver,
  2014-present}

Pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

Expected graduation June 2018
