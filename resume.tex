\section*{Experience}
\subsection*{New Relic \subtitle San Francisco, CA Summer 2016}

Made significant, critical contributions to the newly-launched Infrastructure
product, working closely with my team as well as others to meet critical milestones.

\subsection*{Arrayent \subtitle Redwood City, CA Summer 2015}

Managed and resolved issues with critical production systems with real-time
availability requirements. Learned to effectively instrument and monitor cloud
infrastructure, both with cloud providers like AWS and locally, on the metal.

\subsection*{NASA Ames \subtitle Mountain View, CA 2011-2014}

Worked directly with scientists to develop custom-built tracking solutions as
part of a larger software engineering team. As my first paid position, working
at NASA was crucial to developing a professional work ethic, and shaping my
skills and communication as a team player.

\section*{Personal Projects}

I always look for ways to deepen my understanding of computer science, and
personal projects provide the perfect opportunity.

\subsection*{BIS2}

This bash history search project is something I use every day. It matches a
frontend to a fast fuzzy search algorithm to make for a better search interface
for command history in terminal.

\subsection*{Kernel}

Curiosity, and the desire to know how things work drive my interests in a major
way. Kernel is my effort to build an OS kernel how I wish they could be, with a
focus on transactions and modularity.

\subsection*{FLX}

Fast, full-text search is a very important feature of many of my workflows. FLX
is a general-use full-text search algorithm, which scores any number of lines of
text based on an input query. It is great as a highly-optimized backend to BIS2,
searching up to a million lines in under a second.

\section*{Skills}

Twelve years of experience in software engineering, including as a team member
in many different situations. 

Diverse work with projects using many industry-tested tools and frameworks, such
as Spring, React, ElasticSearch.

Deep interest in cutting edge technologies, such as ES6, C++17, and Rust, and a
desire to further my understanding whenever possible.
