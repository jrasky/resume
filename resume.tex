\section*{Personal Projects}

\subsection*{BIS2}

This bash history search project is something I use every day. It matches a
frontend to a fast fuzzy search algorithm to make for a better search interface
for command history in terminal.

\subsection*{Kernel}

Curiosity, and the desire to know how things work drive my interests in a major
way. Kernel is my effort to build an OS kernel how I wish they could be, with a
focus on transactions and modularity.

\subsection*{FLX}

Fast, full-text search is a very important feature of many of my workflows. FLX
is a general-use full-text search algorithm, which scores any number of lines of
text based on an input query. It is great as a highly-optimized backend to BIS2,
searching up to a million lines in under a second.
